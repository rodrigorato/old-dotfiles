# dotfiles
The dotfiles I'm using in my Ubuntu 15.10 with i3wm

dependencies:

 - [Yosemite San Francisco font](https://github.com/supermarin/YosemiteSanFranciscoFont) used as the system's main font;
 - [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases) used for logos here and there;
 - [Arc GTK Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) a GTK theme that's better than default;
 - [i3lock](http://i3wm.org/i3lock/) with scrot, imagemagick and dbus for the lock screen;
 - [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) because dmenu sucks (not really, rofi's just prettier imo);
 - [compton](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compton) to fade colors and animations;
 - [i3gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) because gaps;
 - [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) to manage the bar blocks;

Might be missing something but oh well, won't find out until I reinstall my OS I guess.

Still looking pretty bad, looking forward to improving it over time.

Using Chromium browser, Atom editor the Thunar file explorer and Dropbox to sync folder right now so you might find references to those in the /.i3/config file.
